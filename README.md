# Run Project

#### 1. Install

```sh
yarn install
```

#### 2. DB migration

```sh
cd packages/db-main-prisma
# generate ts interface
yarn prisma generate
# create db schema
yarn prisma-db-push
# fill seed data
yarn prisma-db-seed
```

#### 3. Config .env file

config openai ai endpoint and key

```sh
cd apps/nextjs-app
copy .env.example .env.development.local
```

open .env.development.local

> OpenAI is not available in some country. To solve this problem, we recommend using https://api-openai.teable.io as an endpoint. This is an unrestricted proxy deployed on Vercel.

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT=openai-endpoint
```

#### 4. Run dev server

you should only start backend, it will start next server for front-end automatically, file change will be auto reload

```sh
cd apps/nestjs-backend
tsc --build --watch
# run in a new terminal
yarn dev
```
